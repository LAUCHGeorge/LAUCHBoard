# LAUCHBoard
A UK based keyboard layout, modified to suit my needs.

For now, I will not provide fully built releases, but instead only the .klc files.
You will need to build these yourself with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, which is a quite straightforward process.

In the future I might provide the fully built releases.

You are free to modify this how ever you wish.
