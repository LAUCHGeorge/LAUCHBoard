# LAUCHBoard
A UK based keyboard layout, modified to suit my needs.

This keyboard layout was created with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, in which you can open the .klc files.
A fully built version with an installer, is provided in the Releases section.

You are free to modify this how ever you wish.
